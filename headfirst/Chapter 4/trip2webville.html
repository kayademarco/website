    <li>What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company?</li>
    <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution?</li>
    <li>What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?</li>
    <li>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it. 
    <li>What is the process involved?</li> 
    <li>Where can you go to register a domain name?</li>
    <li>Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. How are they different?</li>
    <li>How are they similar?</li>
