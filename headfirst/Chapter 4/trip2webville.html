    <li>What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company?
    What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? 
    What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this class we have solved the problem of finding a host by using the platform GitHub. This platform allows us to publish websites with our own domain with their "watermark" of sorts.</li>
            <li>The advantages of using GitHub are that you can easily share your website and code with others. This helps us when collaborating with others. Another advantage is that it allows for version control which allows you to branch off and try new things without having a lot of collateral damage.</li>
            <li>The disadvantage of GitHub is that you can not host a commerce page or anything that requires back-end communication (forms, chat, etc)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. 
    See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it. 
    What is the process involved?
    Where can you go to register a domain name?</li>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    <li>Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. 
    How are they different?
    How are they similar?</li>
        <ul>
